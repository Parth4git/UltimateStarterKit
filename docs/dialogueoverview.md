# Dialogue System
## Introduction
The Ultimate Starter Kit plugin contains a full dialogue system with support for different participants, choices and brances

## Creating a new dialogue
You can create a new dialogue by following these steps:
1. Right click in the Content Browser
2. Go to the Ultimate Starter Kit section
3. Click on Dialogue

This will open the newly created dialogue in the dialogue editor

## Using the editor
The dialogue editor works similar to a Behaviour Tree. You start by creating a single root node. You can then drag connections to a new dialogue entry. The game will start off with the root and follow the path automatically until it reaches the end or a choice. If a choice is encountered, it will present the options to the player and follow the correct branch after a choice is selected
